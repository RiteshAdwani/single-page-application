# single-page-application

- A single-page application (SPA) is a web application or website that interacts with the user by dynamically rewriting the current web page with new data from the web server, instead of the default method of a web browser loading entire new pages.
- The goal is faster transitions that make the website feel more like a native app.
- In a SPA, a page refresh never occurs.
- This website is an example of SPA, that means, on clicking any link for a section, the website isn't refreshed and directly scrolls to that section.
- In this website, there are 5 sections : Home, Services, Work, Images and About.
